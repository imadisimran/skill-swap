# Skill-Swap

## Purpose

Skill-Swap is a dynamic web platform designed to foster a community of peer-to-peer learning and knowledge exchange. The core purpose of this project is to create an environment where individuals can both offer their expertise and seek out new skills from others.

Whether you're a an expert in a particular field, a hobbyist, or just someone looking to learn something new, Skill-Swap provides the tools to connect you with the right people. Users can create profiles, showcase the skills they are willing to teach, and browse or search for skills they wish to learn, facilitating a simple and effective way to "swap" knowledge within the community.
